1885959,Archived,Residential Rental Maintenance,"The AC in my unit has been down for roughly 10 days now. I've tried contacting the sales manager, general manager, and office employees multiple times without a single response. They seem to be ignoring my situation. Both my roommate and I have sent complaints and we haven't heard back from them regarding the issue. I finally get my attorney involved last week and they told me that they would have the AC fixed by last Thursday or Friday or would add an extra portable AC unit. However they failed to respond after that. Then I contacted the general manager on Friday asking about the AC and he replied that he'd have it fixed by the weekend, and if not he would install a window AC on Monday. It's Tuesday now and he is continuing to ignore my messages. Its summer in Gainesville FL and without AC, one cannot live in a closed space. My roommate and I have been getting sick because of the upwards of 88 degree temperature in our apartment. The maintenence crew put a ""small room"" size portable AC in our apartment and explained that it would only be a few days. It has been almost 2 weeks and this small room AC can only cool the living room. Another issue is that my roof is leaking in my apartment when it rains. Instead of coming to fix it or patch it up, the maintenance says ""its okay for now"". Many doors around the complex are always open and it makes me feel unsafe. I also have a problem with trash piling up in the garage near the trash shoots. Noone ever cleans them up so they tend to fill up one or two parking spaces. Also, the only elevator on the premises has an expired permit.

The other concern is if it falls it would knock down all power, phone and cable for all of 10th Avenue in addition to all power, phone and cable that runs down 15th street as it would fall right in the middle of the intersection and catch both sides of the utilities.  I think the city should remove the tree and eliminate the risk to life and property and the hours and cost of repairing the whole utility lines for my neighborhood.",8/12/2020 6:46,7/21/2020 18:20,0,8708,6,Urban Forestry Division,Mark,1504 NW 10TH AVE,29.66146799,-82.34153097,POINT (-82.3415309667315 29.661467992543),1,4

This bus-stop is right at a curve in the road. This could easily have been avoided if there were some bollards on the curb at the bus-stop, so that even if cars lose control on the curve, they wouldn't get on to the sidewalk. Since the bollards are on the curb, it wouldn't affect vehicular movement on the road nor restrict pedestrians on the sidewalk. I've contacted Gainesville Public Works Department (service request # 5836) and said they would approve bollards if it was required. Kindly look into this.

I understand Supervisor, Billy Dampier was supposed to look at the hydrant on June 4, 2018 but it is still leaking. If there's a fire and Gainesville Fire Rescue needs to use it, will the integrity of the fire hydrant caused by this continual leak affect their response?

There are two ponds on this beautiful wooded area which flow into the storm drainage stream that runs along the bike trail between 45th and 39th Ave.
We’ve lived here in this area since 1999, and walk this sidewalk twice a day, and have never seen this done, why would y’all start this nonsense now? The only plants that were growing there were Spanish Needle, a native wildflower and important pollinator plant. They could have been easily cut down ( IF they were a problem, which they weren’t) instead of using a herbicide?

People are tossing them out in the wild, they cannot survive, their DNA is totally different. I am already working with my local officials to stop the sales of rabbits in stores. I am also in contact with local Congressmen and the Governor to put a Bill into place like California has, starting in 2019. The sales of Dogs, Cats and Rabbits will end, only rescue or shelter animals will be sold. This is turning into an environmental hazard, as they spread disease to other domestic animals and humans. I urge your Government to stop the sales of rabbits. The rabbits at this store are ending up in shelters to be destroyed when they get to old and or a rescue will step in and take. The rescues, all over Florida are full with more coming in everyday. Please help us make this happen, sooner then later. I live in St. Lucie County and Port St Lucie, my Mayor is already putting it into place. We also had the law changed, NO sales or giving away of Baby Rabbits under the age of 8 weeks. Please ask any rescue, how you can tell the difference, so your Animal Control and enforce this new law. Gainesville Rabbit Rescue is overwhelmed and trying to save every Rabbit that comes through that store, and its just to much. I work closely with a lot of the rescues and everyone is overwhelmed. Please contact them and ask how this can be stopped.

The remaining trunk obstructs the view when traffic is trying to turn onto NW 6th from 15th Ave, forcing drivers to inch forward to see around the remaining trunk and impeding the crosswalk for pedestrians especially handicapped people in wheelchairs.  Now the remaining trunk has sprouted side branches all along its remaining wood, further blocking the view of traffic heading north on 6th Street for cars trying to turn from 15th Avenue.  These new branches are creating a serious hazard. Trimming those branches will only alleviate the problem until they grow back.

6156370,Archived,Trash/Debris (Private Property),"Currently NW 55th Blvd is clean due to private citizens doing a clean-up. But it is a pervasive problem that the property owners should take care of.  The next road on NW 55th Ave. is currently terribly littered.

""I live in an apartment complex on NW 55th Blvd and the amount of litter people toss out of their cars daily is astounding. It is a curvy road with no sidewalks, in a wooded area, with two gas stations nearby. It is my understanding that this street is not managed by the City of Gainesville and it is not managed by Alachua County (although the EPA does drive by to check Hogtown Creek). Public Works does not mow or remove the litter. I’m told the street is privately owned, but only Creekwood Apts (where I live) picks up litter in front of their property. So, is there a way to contact the street owner? Particularly Palmetto Crerk and Palmetto Walk, which both have copious Litter along their entrances, in the woods. Is this a code violation? I’d like to discuss whether I am allowed to put up signage to encourage folks to keep NW 55th Blvd street clean. See my Instagram account #LitterFreeGNV to view some of the litter I’ve picked up there in only a few months. I find diapers, syringes, and drug baggies regularly, and we live near the creek! . It is relentless. People dump tires and all kinds of other stuff in the forest and on roadsides, as well. We need a litter education campaign in Gville that goes beyond the annual Great American Clean-up. That event is great, but it’s not enough... I see litter all over Gville and it saddens me. I’m sure the plastic bag and styrofoam ban will help; but a bottle deposit would also help; I find tons of recyclables, too. I’d like to discuss how you can help me help my neighborhood.""",8/12/2020 2:56,7/25/2019 10:31,24479,24483,17,Public Works Department (Primary),An anonymous SeeClickFix user,NW 55TH AVE,29.70476441,-82.34990993,POINT (-82.3499099255722 29.7047644064056),1,2

Message:
Hello, On April 10 <(>&<)> 11, 2019, GRU did an emergency replacement of
my water feed line and this problem was caused by the SE 4th street
construction project. The line replacement caused the ""rainwater
management curb"" in front of my house to be damaged. The rainwater curb
keeps my house from flooding and the road run-off from going down the
hill to Sweetwater Creek. Please consider re-evaluating the storm water
management on SE 14th Place as a lot of rainwater runs from the crest of
14th Place (which is most of the road) towards my house. Thank you,

This causes a large accumulation of standing water that I am concerned to be a health hazard as the water backs up and inundates the play area and parking lot making it difficult for parent pick up and drop off.  As well, the standing water is likely to be a risk as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria where there are obviously children present. I understand that this is private property, but if the drainage system was damaged from a tree on city property, and in the interest of the children who attend this facility, I'd like to encourage GRU or City of Gainesville to take another look at this problem before it becomes a serious health risk. The water stands for days on end after heavy rains.

When will construction resume? The project report states that construction will be competed in July 2019.  This report has not been updated since December 2018, leaving concerned citizens with many unanswered questions.  If construction was shelved due to the holidays, it should not have even began until afterwards, as we are only talking about a couple months. Furthermore, the fact that roadwork ceased at this point in the construction phase reflects extremely poor planning and a disregard for safety, not to mention misuse of taxpayer dollars.

As this home business appears to be unregistered, it may not be collecting required bed taxes or reporting income or meeting safety and sanitation requirements.

The website (see below) advertising her property says she is renting out two of her three bedrooms as well as a couch elsewhere in the home for nightly or longer stays (some as long as 40 days according to reviews). She does not let her guests park in her driveway and as a result there are often three or more vehicles parked on the street in front of hers and her neighbors’ homes. This is a hindrance to emergency and other vehicles on the narrow street as well as an inconvenience to neighbors parking and coming or leaving their properties.

2578016,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"I am not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but traffic going north on 34th street gets really backed up from 4-6PM before the intersection with W University Avenue.  Sometimes it backs up all the way up the hill by the wall with the graffiti and goes down the other side.  Not sure if anyone else has witnessed this, but I would imagine so since lots of people seem to be caught in the traffic every day.  Perhaps they are distracted by looking at the graffiti and don't really notice.  While I like the 34th street wall a lot, I don't really like being rear-ended by people coming over the hill near the wall and then suddenly finding that the middle lane is completely backed up.  In worrying about being rear-ended, I don't really get a chance to admire the handiwork on the wall unfortunately.  
Luckily for the very few people turning left on University, there are two completely traffic free turn lanes for them to choose from.  They don't have to worry.  The left turn people are the super lucky few.  The right turn people on to W University also get a nice empty lane to themselves as well, and even have the option of turning right on 25A, and so probably don't really even need a whole turn lane to themselves, but lucky them, they got one anyway.  
Meanwhile the one center lane that goes straight just backs up every day, over the hill, past the nice graffiti wall, full of people who work hard all day and just want to get home to their kids.  Those poor people just trying to get home wait for the light at W University Avenue to change 3-4 times between five and six o'clock before they cross. 
It is worth noting that if you are coming south on NW 34th Avenue towards W Univ Ave, there are three lanes to choose from, and only one turn lane.  Somehow, when the redesign of the intersection happened, it was determined that a single lane road coming south should widen to three lanes at University Ave, while the three busy lanes going north should narrow to one lane prior to University Avenue, with two left turn lanes and one right turn lane flanking a crowded center lane.   
Anyway, hope that something can be done, and I encourage everyone stuck in the northbound single lane from 4-6PM to utilize the SeeClickFix app on your phone or call your local government representatives to let them know how you feel about this intersection.  Just don't text and drive!  Well, you will be sitting there for a long while so maybe it is safe to text or call.  Again though, it is probably only me and I am just being crazy and impatient thinking that we could have two lanes going north instead of one.  I should just enjoy the graffiti and relax.  My kids don't need me that badly, they will be just fine.  Maybe I should encourage them to paint the wall at that time, at least that way I would get to see them a little sooner after a long day at work :/",12/18/2019 15:55,7/5/2016 11:54,4942,36842,26,Public Works Department (Primary),soodohnim,3401 W UNIVERSITY AVE,29.65202651,-82.37235237,POINT (-82.3723523650831 29.6520265129911),1,3

The vacant lot to the immediate north of our property at 1109 NE 2nd Street now has a squatter living in a tent. Our granddaughter lives next to this lot, and our two dogs and our son’s dog all use our lot freely, which is immediately next to the tent of the squatter.

The police department suggested that I contact you to start a process to get these people moved. The estate of a local family owns the lot, and I don’t know how to contact them. This isn't safe for our family, nor sanitary, nor is it fair to those who have tried to beautify this section of our neighborhood. There are several tents on the block one block closer to 16th Ave., on land owned by the City (adjoining NE Park), and the fact that the City has allowed those squatters to remain for more than a year is probably why this squatter feels no one will remove them. I'm hoping you can help us protect the safety and sanitation of our neighborhood.

Please let me know if I've reached you, and if there is anything we can do from here.

3692800,Archived,Road Repair,"Hello,

I'm a life-long Gainesville resident and am on faculty at UF. I'm sorry to bother you, I tried calling earlier today and discovered your office was closed for the storm. I respect you're busy with storm preparations, as am I, and hope all is going well for you & your families.

I'm reaching out to you as I'm very concerned about the construction on NE 6th Avenue between 1st and 5th Streets.
My home is at 305 NE 6th Avenue, I've lived upstairs since 2003 and my father moved in to the downstairs in 2014, he passed away in April from cancer, so I now own both units and am hosting guests evacuating from Miami, in his home, for the storm.

For the past 2-3 months there has been construction on NE 6th Ave between 1st - 5th Streets.
The road was just paved a few days ago and it appears the gutters & curbs are under construction.
I fear that during the storm, in the sections that remain unfinished, the dirt will erode and the entire area will flood.
However, I'm most afraid of the 8 barricades (they look like this: http://www.bobsbarricades.com/bimages/products/barracade1.jpg) currently installed along the north & west sides of NE 6th Ave in the 300 block (immediately in front of my home, built in 1912).

Officials have repeatedly warned that any unsecured objects may become airborne and act as projectiles, shattering windows, etc.
My home is 103 years old and all of the windows are original and impossible to replace (the lovely warped glass). Earlier today I spent two hours moving everything in our yard that's not buried/secured, into the garage-- the porch furniture, potted plants, hoses, our mailbox, trash & recycling bins, etc., as I'm doing the best I can to prevent storm damage.  Can someone please insure me that those barricades will all be removed prior to Sunday?

Ideally, I'd love to hear that the gutters and curbs will also be completed before the rain begins as the lack of concrete in those areas is likely going to cause water to erode the dirt, pool, and flood-- impacting my yard & home and the Thomas Center south-side parking lot.

With much appreciation & respect,

We have been without power since Monday. A large tree fell in our neighbors yard ontop of our power line and knocked out power for my house, our immediate neighbor to the right, and the two house behind us. We have reported this issue to GRU every day, sometimes a couple times a day since our outage occurred. Every other house on our street has power. We are right across from the Law Library on UF's campus. We don't understand why our problem is continually unresolved. I feel as if we may be overlooked because we are the first two houses on the street and all other homes have power so it couple be possible that GRU thought this entire street was fixed when it has not been.

Please help us fix this problem in a timely manner. This is an old home and it's beginning to wreak of mildew from the heat. Also-- school has resumed normal operations and we are still living without power. Help us understand why this problem isn't resolved! Is there something more we should be doing?

7927706,Archived,Noise Complaint,"I rented a house on 1st ave and wasn’t told about the massive Hub construction project I’d be living next to. They start with concrete mixers at around 2 AM most nights, keeping me from falling asleep, and even if I do manage to get to sleep I’m woken up at 6 AM by power tools and yelling directly outside my bedroom window. I haven’t gotten more than 4 hours of sleep in months. Even when I’m struggling to stay awake during the day while doing school work, I can’t focus from the constant noise, and I can’t attend online class or take exams at my own home, something which is extremely detrimental as libraries are closed. The workers also take up EVERY street parking spot, block both exits to the street, often park in my driveway completely blocking me in, and my car has suffered multiple damages from construction equipment and nails left in the road. They also leave trash around my house, including directly outside my window where they take their breaks, and have broken my outside fence. This noise and lack of sleep has had a considerable effect on my physical and mental health as well as my academics.

The raised berm in the Clear Lake area has all sorts of roots growing out of the top of the berm that need to be cut back. The dirt washes away from the top of the berm, exposing the roots.  Lots and lots of people walk on the berm every day.  You even have a real nice parking area for people to park at when they want to drive over to the berm and go for a walk on the top of the berm.  
The roots that are on the surface of the berm present a major trip and fall hazard to the people who walk on the berm. These roots used to be covered up with soil that has since washed away. You don’t need to put more dirt on the berm to cover up the roots. You just need to send someone out there to cut and remove the roots that have become exposed over time. They present a trip and fall hazard to the people who walk on the berm for exercise.

Please send someone out to cut the roots that are sticking out along the top of the berm.  I have tripped on them myself.
Please respond and let me know what you are going to do about this.
Thank you.

There is a four-way stop at this very low traffic intersection.

7776216,Archived,Street Sign,"With lesser traffic on the roads, this might be the time to address this issue. For cars coming down the hill on 23rd St and approaching 8th Ave, at the junction, it is very difficult to see the vehicles coming down the hill (i.e. going east to west) due to lack of line of sight. This is particularly hazardous for those vehicles which intend to turn left. The drivers have to inch forward almost into inrushing traffic going west to east to make sure (a) there's no traffic on the left coming from the direction of 34th St and (b) after going quite a bit, then get the visibility of vehicles coming from the direction of 22nd St. The latter vehicles, coming down the hill, are often quite fast. So, the poor driver who's trying to turn left on 8th Ave suddenly finds herself trying to pull away from those cars coming down the hill, and the drivers on those cars then are trying to decelerate in the last second. This is all due to the fact that the cars that are on 23rd St cannot see the cars on 8th Ave (and vice versa) until they have forwarded well into 8th Ave. This is quite dangerous, and there needs to be some sort of a traffic signal at that intersection so that cars coming down the hill on 8th Ave know that they have to slow down in order to allow the cars on 23rd St turn safely right onto 8th Ave.",11/19/2020 6:13,11/19/2020 6:13,5203,281547,196,Public Works Department (Primary),An anonymous SeeClickFix user,NW 23RD ST & NW 8TH AVE,29.65953096,-82.35652451,POINT (-82.3565245125013 29.6595309591424),1,3

Dear Helen Warren,  as I send this, there is a crew from DOC cutting weeds out of the drainage ditches on SE 20 St.  This is the first time the weeds have been trimmed in over a year.

As I told you, the 10 houses on this street pay $1080.00 a year for stormwater  maintenance.  The ditches, now clear of weeds are still holding too much water.  I've been here 32 years, and the ditches used to work.  I want the ditches to drain.  They are not meant to be a half-mile retention pond breeding mosquitoes.

I want the culverts ""jetted"", the process using high pressure water to clear the dirt and debris from the culverts.

He stated that the alligator approached him. 

When a call is received via the Hotline from a visitor to a city, county or state park, we make every effort to let the managing authority of this area be aware of the complaint.  You may have staff that monitor these areas and are aware of the alligators that are residents there and are comfortable with their presence.
 
Additionally, we stand ready to assist with the dispatch of a nuisance alligator trapper should you decide that you have an alligator that you wish to have removed; however, that decision is entirely yours.

Be aware that if a permit is issued and a trapper dispatched, any alligator that is 4ft or larger is harvested, which means it is killed.
 
Please let us know if you have any questions.
You may contact SNAP via Email (SNAP@MyFWC.com) or by calling the SNAP Hotline directly, at the number listed below, where any operator will be happy to assist you.
 
The reference # associated with this complaint is 448578.

About six weeks ago, a tree located in the front yard of Alex and Jodi Farmer, my next door neighbors, was removed by the city of Gainesville.  Three weeks later, my neighbors across the street, Jack and Gretchen Grisby, had a tree removed in their front yard, also by the city of Gainesville and at no charge to them.  At some point during this time, my property was marked by GRU without my knowledge or consent.  Had my college-age child not been home, we would not have known how the stakes appeared in our yard.  On October 29, I was notified that I had a certified letter and waited over an hour to pick it up at the downtown Post Office. This letter was from E. Di Muccio and was a Notice of Violation regarding a dead tree in My yard and that, in order to clear the violation, I would have to have it taken down - at my own expense - by November 28. No tree was marked in my yard at the time, so I had to have the city arborist return to my property to mark the offending tree.  On further review, the tree seems to be located along the same public/ private line as my neighbor's tree. The tree that was recently removed at the city expense.
 
I am a divorced single mother, working for a non- profit company and I cannot afford to have this tree taken down, especially during the holiday season.  This situation has caused great hardship for me and for my family. I implore you to take another look at the property line and if there is any way to have the city help me, I would appreciate it.  I can be reached at my workplace at 548-1000 (from 8am - 4pm), or email: snyoung@oakhammock.org, or my cell phone: (352) 317-5319.  Thank you for your consideration on this matter.

The Mayor and the Commissioners of Gainesville,

My neighborhood streets were recently repaired for pot holes and rough spots. The streets were solid, smooth and level. This turned out excellent. 

Then  you ruined the streets with slop put down by ASPHALT PAVING SYSTEMS. Now the streets are worse than they were. Some streets around here got real solid smooth asphalt. We got this.

The way it was done was terrible. A layer of gravel and tar was put down without warning and suddenly we couldn’t leave our house or return to them, and then we had to drive on it. A week later came the top coat. Same thing. I was ready to go to work and suddenly there’s wet tar in front of my house. I COULD NOT GO TO WORK. PEOPLE COULD NOT GO HOME. No warning. The crew said “Oh well.” This is inexcusable.  You should have warned people. Everyone I’ve talked to is livid.

Then there is the quality of the job. My street, 46th Place, is bad. 47th Avenue is even worse. But then they did pave it in the rain. Tar and water don’t mix.

It is rough, uneven, and peeling up. Weeds are growing through it already. It looks bad. Cars and trucks – especially the garbage trucks - tore it up. Cars that rode smooth now buzz with vibration. Everyone is commenting on how bad this is now, how bad it will be in a few months or a few years, what it will do to our property values. I can now see what  other streets were paved with this substance. It did not hold up – now they are ruts of gravel. This is my neighborhood’s future.

It is clear what this ASPHALT PAVING SYSTEMS is a bad product and they don’t care about the people who live here. It should not been used on a public street. This product should not be used again.

Has anyone from Public Works come to check the work? Have you asked the people who live on these streets about it?  Is there any quality control or follow up? I think the answers are “No.” 

If you think any of this is acceptable, think again. If you can’t afford to do it right, do not do it wrong. This was wrong.

3585601,Archived,Street Sign,"Commissioner Arreola received the following e-mail from Mr. Scott Oldham (352-316-5378 or soldham1@cox.net):

Dear Mr. Arreola,

I am writing you today to see if you can help with a problem in our sub-division.  Several months ago there was an auto accident at the entrance to Monterey at NW 34th Place and NW 43rd Street.  A vehicle went off the road and struck and damaged the sign for Monterey.  The driver of the car that damaged the sign was insured with Progressive Select Insurance Company.  One of our neighbors contacted Progressive and met with an adjuster to see about getting the sign repaired.  Progressive has denied the claim on the following basis.

Monterey sub-division does not have an active Home Owners Association that is responsible for the common areas of the development and therefore does not have an insurable interest in the sign.

It is true that we no longer have an HOA for this development.  Back shortly after the sub-division was built the original developer dissolved the HOA and deeded the common areas like the streets and entrance signs to the County.  When the city later annexed this area they became responsible for the common areas.  So at this point I understand the City of Gainesville is the owner of the entrance sign and would have an insurable interest in that property.

I am asking you for so assistance to see what can be done to repair the sign without any cost to the homeowners of Monterey or The City of Gainesville.  Maybe if the City Attorney were to talk to the adjuster from Progressive there could be a solution to this problem.

I know that the State of Florida requires all owners/operators of a motor vehicle to have Property Damage insurance of at least $10,000.  The State also requires the motor vehicle owner to pay for damage done to the property of others due to an automobile accident.  The problem here seems to revolve around just who owns the sign and has the insurable interest.

Please let me know if there is someway the City of Gainesville can help us get the sign repaired.  The homeowners have maintained the entrance planters and kept the sign painted for many years.  All we are asking is that the sign be repaired.  

Adjuster: Janae Liptlippap. Progressive Insurance Company Claim # 171523285 Adjusters Ph# 352-415-4289

Thanks for you time and understanding.

Sincerely

Scott Oldham

However, as is the way of all things Hogtown traffic, we take one step forward and one step back. Now the light at SW 40th Blvd is timed way too long, causing morning traffic on Archer to pile up there, backing vehicles up all the way to the 75 exit and preventing drivers (who are already experiencing long exit lines due to the missing lane) from being able to exit the off ramp onto Archer on the green light. Please take a look at this situation - the traffic coming off SW 40th in the AM is miniscule and doesn't need such a long interval.

The problem is that the trailer while parked on the street covers half way of the bicycle lane making real dangerous for bicyclist going north on 9th Street. I have experienced this situation many times my self  and see other bikers almost get hit by Cars.  I have seen the owners of the trailer watching the situation and appears to me they don't care. I kindly ask to please do something about this situation that is putting bicyclist life at risk. If you need more info please let me know,
Thank You

This has to be the busiest stop on this route and it's poor design creates traffic/safety issues every time a bus has to stop there. Will it take a fatality to fix this issue or can someone who designed this two lane back-up problem explain why the project went forward without remedying this area of concern in the first place.

I am concerned about the safety of this drain as it is amply large enough for a toddler or small child to fit inside/crawl into and suffer injury or drown. Of course, good supervision is the first line of defense for any tragedy like this happening, but this does not eradicate the need to ensure that safety measures are in place.

This request is regarding the streetlight directly across from 1315 NE 7th Terrace. Within the past six month the bulb was replaced and now the light is substantially brighter than all of the other lights on the street and is currently shining brightly in my window every night.

I had contacted the city previously regarding this issue and they indicated the issue was due to a new bulb. However, while I do appreciate the attempt at safety, without a deflector limiting the pole's range to around the street it instead creates a situation where it feels like there is a full moon every night or a flashlight shining directly into my window. Other houses in the immediate vicinity are shielded from the excessively bright light.

Please modify the light so I am able to get quality sleep again.

Subject: Rat infestation Gainesville apartment complex

Dear Mr. Mayor,

I live near the Village/Forest Green Apartments on N.E. 15th Street. I can tell you from decades of experience that they have a major rat infestation that they refuse to address. At night you can see the rats feasting in and around the dumpsters--both of which are placed near N.E. 15th street. 

These dumpsters are nothing but rat smorgasbords.

With the recent outbreak of rat borne illness killing one and seriously sickening others in New York City I think it is time that the City implement some sort of policy to directly address this before we have such an outbreak here. With the spring approaching my understanding is that the heat  will exacerbate the problem so now is the time to act.

Forest/Village Green Apartments needs to first move the dumpsters away from the highway at the front of the complex and place them instead at the back of the apartment complex adjacent to the forest so that the rats will be better contained on THEIR property and not be spilling over to the surrounding neighborhoods. 

Not only will this help to alleviate the problem to their neighbors, it will also remedy the incredible eyesore that the dumpsters cause when they are filled to overflowing--which is especially evident whenever a tenant moves out and leaves behind such items as soiled mattresses, dilapidated furniture, cast off clothes, etc., which are usually piled up around the dumpster, not in it, thereby allowing the rats easy ingress to the dumpster. 

Also, rats enter the water drain holes in the bottom of the dumpster. Water usually enters the dumpsters when it rains and a tenant leaves the lid open--which the rats also use as a convenient ladder to enter the dumpster, or they climb up the items piled around the dumpster and jump in. It is this easy ingress and egress which needs to stop. 

Once the dumpsters are moved some sort of rodent control needs to be implemented immediately to lessen the population dramatically. 

BTW, visit the dumpster any time around midnight the night before weekly trash pickup and you will witness first hand what I am asserting here. 

This issue needs to be addressed BEFORE there is an outbreak here. 

I hope that this email does not fall on deaf ears.

Thank you for considering my complaint.

With respect,

Steven Kahler

A close family friend resides at 4111 NW 22nd Drive in the Edgewood II Subdivision. She has contacted the City of Gainesville Code
Enforcement Office on numerous occasion concerning the condition of the property next door (subject property), without any change in
the conditions except that more “personal property” has been added.

If you reviewed the attached pictures which were taken October 25, 2016, I think you will agree that there are several code violations
occurring here. There are numerous vehicles, including a trailer, which if I understand the law correctly must be operational, licensed
and insured. I have not verified the validity of the vehicles. I do not believe that placing a storage shed on the front driveway as a permanent
building is not according to code.

Not only is  the property unsightly, it serves to bring down the entire neighborhood. This place is a dangerous fire situation.  In the event
of an emergency at this address there is no way that the fire and rescue personnel could operate properly. The rear yard is also loaded
with “personal property”.  The property condition and being located in a wooded area and with all the accumulated “personal property” not
only poses a fire threat to itself but to the entire Edgewood II neighborhood.

I have been advised, but not substantiated that a minor child resided in this household.

Any assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated by the entire neighborhood.

Thank you,

RE: Request timeline for action to remedy flooding on 10th Terrace
Flooding Currently  Too High For Normal Automobile Traffic, including, grocery store, medical appointments and prescription med refills.
Flooding has failed to recede after 2 days due to non-functioning City drains at NW 16th Ave and 10th Terrace.
(Speaking on behalf of 10th Terrace neighbors)
Neighbors report their automobiles and transportation by foot are Marooned due to high water.  Only High clearance vehicles can navigate 10th Terrace.
It appears the enormous demand on the City sewer system during IRMA may have caused these drains to reverse flow , accelerating flooding on 10th Terrace beyond that of rainfall from IRMA.
With barely 2 inches of receding waters thus far, these storm drains continue without noticeable flood relief on 10th Terrace with 6-8 inches of standing water in front and back yards as of 10 AM today. 
Wildlife and snakes have been observed by at least 2 neighbors.
Flooding of home interiors and carpeting has been reported, but remediation of mold issues cannot begin until contracted service vehicles can navigate 10th terrace without flooding hazard.
One neighbor was told that 10th Terrace residents are cut off from all services, trash pickup and USPS mail.  They wonder if this includes emergency calls to 911 and EMT response.
Please advise a timeline of relief for 10th terrace  residents.
Thanks, Harold

Mr. Saive:
Unfortunately, due to the extent of the down trees and extensive flooding, our crews have many requests for service holding.  The entire staff has been working almost non-stop since the winds subsided enough to begin response and recovery efforts.
If this request is not already in the system, staff will enter the request in CityWorks and the management team will work to get one of the crews assigned to this task.  We cannot give you an exact timeline as to when this street will be addressed.
Someone from our office will be reaching out to you when they have an idea.
As a suggestion for the future, you can also enter these requests directly into the 311GNV app and they get sent directly to the appropriate Department and staff person to ensure that it gets a response.
Please let us know if you have any additional questions or comments.
Sincerely,

Usually, if you're that far back in traffic you're guaranteed to wait at least two cycles to get through the light. Headed west across north 13th is even more difficult.

Hi Sean, 
Hope you are doing well. I just wanted to pass along something I noticed when we were last at the monitoring site (Friday) behind your house. Just outside your back gate, there is a depression in the riprap that I hadn’t noticed before. There was also a noticeable amount of sand in the pool at the bottom of the side slope. It seems like there might be some wash out occurring there. It is probably something the city should be aware of so they can address. Let me know if you have questions. 
Thanks,

3266912,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"There is a designated crosswalk for pedestrians right in front of the Sterling Place neighborhood. It crosses to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street into Blue's Creek. This is an extremely dangerous crossing for any pedestrians, especially our school aged children. The traffic coming out of Blue's Creek is coming around a sharp almost blind curve and they are always speeding. As an adult I have almost been hit crossing with my children who catch the bus by the Blue's Creek pool on two occasions. It is not much better for traffic coming into the neighborhood either. Although their visibility is not hampered by the curve, they just do not stop for people waiting to cross. I stood there with 5 other middle school aged children the other day while 14 cars zoomed by. The 15th car stopped for us. This is a regular occurrence, we just decided to count the cars. Since the new added construction traffic of dump trucks, large construction equipment, workers trucks parked on the side of the road, etc. the visibility is even worse and it is unsafe to cross. This is always been a concern, but has been made worse with the new phase of town homes being built across from Sterling Place. Also, the pedestrian crossing sign was down several times since they extended the sidewalk, although I saw a city truck out there last week hopefully putting it back up correctly. I would like to see one of 2 things done, both ideally. 1. move the official crossing east so that it is not right at the entrance to Sterling Place where the traffic comes around the curve right into it. It could easily be moved to where there is already a small paved sidewalk that leads from the road to the sidewalk that runs along the Sterling Place wall. That would allow more time for those leaving Blue's Creek to see people in the walk. 2. I would like to see one of those more visible pedestrians crossings with the flashing lights that notify drivers that there is someone in the crossing. I would hate for it to take a serious injury or death before this issue is resolved.",9/27/2018 3:13,3/16/2017 14:45,17,2885,2,Public Works Department (Primary),April Tisher,7316 NW 73RD AVE,29.72153046,-82.39512968,POINT (-82.3951296840376 29.7215304551355),1,2

It is also the fault of a homeless bum who used to live there. Is there a team of people who can be dispatched to clean the place up? It is a shame to see Gainesville's forests and creeks getting treated with such disrespect. The city workers should not have to go in and clean up the mess of others, but unfortunately it has gotten to that. thank you,",9/27/2018 4:42,5/1/2017 12:28,53,28749,20,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),City Clerk's Office 2,NW 36TH RD AND NW 13TH ST,29.6853233,-82.3389792,POINT (-82.3389792 29.6853233),3,2

2123247,Archived,Grass (Overgrown),Owners of 1735 NW 7th Place have not kept their front or back yard maintained for years. They claim that the plants that are grown have been there for many years and there has been at least one complaint issued in 2014 that was closed. Neighbors are expected to keep up the adjacent yards but Joe Schmid and Collopy allow their yard and house to be in complete disrepair. In November a neighbors tree split and fell on the garage at 1735. The limb was removed by Schmids and the rest of the tree was cut down at the 1743 residence at the owners expense. The damage to the building was assessed as repairable- however the existing roof extends 8 inches over the 1743 property line. The damaged materials from the roof and overhang is still in the 1743 neighbors yard. 1743 owner requested the debris to be removed several times. Schmids instead asked to store a Pod over the 1743 property because he does not want to clean his own yard enough to place the Pod in his own yard. Because of the foliage and weeds growing In the back yard the 1743 owner can only remove part of the second large tree that the city arborist requested. Schmid has called the 1743 owner twice about being concerned that the limb from the second tree will fall into his yard on the plants. Tree contractor advised that there is not enough access to the largest limb that extends into 1735 yard because of the overgrown state. 1743 owner is constructing a fence beginning today and cannot get clear access to part of the fence line because of the roof overhang and other items that Schmid has not cleaned up.

There is a dirt parking lot behind these 3 houses that fits 15 cars, however it's always submerged under inches of water. The parking lot has large craters all over that allow rain water to accumulate and sit for days on end. Our cars are parked in inches of standing water, and we frequently have to take our shoes off just to keep them from getting wet when walking to or from our vehicles. Additionally, these craters are so deep that black cables are exposed and floating when submerged in water. This presents a considerable safety concern for 15 students consistently entering and leaving the parking lot on scooters throughout the day.

Beyond this, the whole stretch of driving south between NW 5th ave and NW 2nd ave on NW 15th is treacherous, due to narrow lanes, and many people turning in and out of side streets.  Today, someone hit me as I was traveling south on NW 15th and they were pulling out of an apartment building. They never even looked left, they were so distracted trying to see around the foliage looking south (to their right), that they just accelerated into the street when they perceived their right of way on the right clear.  Unfortunately, they also failed to look left before accelerating into the street. 

Just a bad street, all around.  Maybe something more can be done than just improving the right of way vision...

Subject: Speeding vehicles


Mr. Mayor,

A few months ago I called to the City in reference to someone changing the road of 5th Street being closed off when the children mostly live and cross on S.E. 3rd Street in the Porters Community.

I have been in the 400 block of S.E. 3rd Street because of a sick cousin, and the 300 block of 3rd Street because of a sick sister; the times I have been on the street I've witnessed car after car speeding through the neighborhood.  For the life of me I can not figure out why the City would close 5th Street where children are not effected by traffic to 3rd Street? You divert traffic to  an area where the Community Center with Basketball Courts are, and where School Bus stops are, and children cross over daily.  

I am wondering where the true concern is, because it appears it is not with the welfare of our children.  I have complained about the roads being closed, and am not letting you know that people are speeding up and down 3rd Street, and the children will be out of school soon for Spring Break.

Changes need to made, and made soon.

Thank you,

2708204,Archived,Other,"As my previous post was archived and cannot be addressed anymore (Issue ID: 2670763), I am creating a new issue.

Thank you Engineer Waite for your comments  and for providing reasoning behind the disparity in access between apartment complexes on the street.  It will probably surprise you that I do not live one of the affected complexes near SW 9th St.  I am a motorist and a bicyclist who frequents the area.  I personally have experienced trouble as people leaving the affected complexes, which house many people, have made U-turns in the median breaks provided for the other less-populated complexes.  Trying to U-turn in the middle of Depot Ave forces some drivers to do a multi-point turn, or infringe on the bike lane.  I don't see how doing U-turns at these breaks is safer given these other problems.
Given the proximity to SW 9th Street, was consideration given to another traffic solution?  Perhaps another traffic circle or ellipsis, that incorportates the intersection as well as the driveways?  This solution seems to work to slow down traffic, increase safety, and allow access in all directions at other points along Depot.  
Again, I  don't live in the affected communities but I do see the problem and have experienced drivers from those communities trying to utilize the limited median breaks to turn.  The improvements to this street are really great, but this is a problem and should be addressed rather than archived.  I hope that Engineer Waite and the other people of Public Works will take another look and find a solution for this remaining problem, just like they did for rest of Depot Ave!",9/26/2018 18:14,8/18/2016 9:27,8765,43295,30,Public Works Department (Primary),soodohnim,936-1018 SW DEPOT AVE,29.6810568,-82.34520841,POINT (-82.3452084098524 29.6810568013611),1,2

With the increased traffic has come increased speeding, and although the speed limit is 35 mph, hardly anyone goes that speed. People routinely drive 40 to 50 mph. How do I know that? Because  a speed monitor was place on the street just before Alpine Way for several days and in walking my dogs twice a day I saw drivers get the flashing light warning that they were over the speed limit.
We are still waiting to see what will be done about this and the strips that are routinely put across the road to monitor traffic volume. It has become unsafe to walk the sidewalks here because of speeding and erratic drivers. On five separate occasions I have seen cars passing on the double yellow line on this street between Alpine Way and Birnam Woods Way. One car did so as our daughter and I were walking our dogs and he almost lost control and did run off the road onto the sidewalk before snatching it back on the road. He came within 15 feet of hitting my daughter!
I am NOT exaggerating in saying this, sooner or later, there will be either a horrible wreck and/or a pedestrian death if something isn't done SOON! These sidewalks are heavily used by pedestrians and bicyclists. Some of these pedestrians are school kids walking to school at Norton or to catch a bus. I walk these sidewalks twice daily and I do not feel safe on this street anymore. We've lived in Forest of the Unicorn since 1999, so I am very familiar with this neighborhood. In talking with my neighbors I know my husband and I aren't the only ones with this concern. 
PLEASE do something (speed bumps, a four way stop, lower the speed limit, and/ or more police patrol writing speeding tickets) to help with this serious problem.
Thank you,

Good evening, 

I’m trying to reach someone to dispute a citation I received today at 12:27. I parked at the holiday Inn off university st. Ran inside chick-fil-a to grab lunch for my wife and I and came back out and my car was booted. There was no sign saying no parking or parking enforced/towing enforced.  I just moved here from Texas and did know where I could park. The immobilization notice is not filled out with any of my vehicle information. I don’t believe I should have been booted and forced to pay $76.75 to have the boot removed.

3619577,Archived,Other,"Back in June I reported a continuing problem of vehicles speeding on 24th Blvd in the Cherry Tree/Forest of the Unicorn/The Lakes area. It is particularly bad between Alpine Drive and 45th Ave.The problem was reported to GPD who said they had addressed it and would be monitoring the situation. I've seen NO such evidence that they are attempting to monitor the speeders on this street. Here was their reply:

""311GNV wrote:
Per GPD, they last addressed this issue 01-26-2017. We deployed the Stealth stat and Speed trailer. The posted speed limit on NW 24th BLVD is 35MPH. Per the speeds recorded by the Stealth Stat, we learned the average speed travelled on the roadway during 01-23-2017/01-27-2017 was 37MPH. It should be noted; however, that it did record a speed of 97MPH. The Traffic Safety Team and zone officers will continue to monitor traffic in this area.""

I seriously DOUBT the average speed is 37 mph!!! After the first day of the speeding device being deployed, logically, most people will drive slower. But there should be GRAVE concerns that even one vehicle was clocked at 97 mph!!! The posted speed is 35, most people are going at least 45 to 50. 
There has been an accident (see attached photo) with a vehicle running off the road and catching on fire at the intersection of 24th Blvd and 45th Ave since I reported this problem. I have personally seen 3 vehicles passing on the double yellow line on this street with oncoming traffic since I first reported this problem. 

School will be starting again soon and there will be children and parents walking in the sidewalks daily. Eventually there is going to be a horrible accident because of the way people are driving on this street. This IS a problem. This street needs, at least, speed bumps put in on the stretch between Alpine Drive and the school zone speed light just beyond Birnam Woods Way. 
I am imploring GPD to take this problem seriously...PLEASE!

9228459,Archived,Other,"I'm a resident who lives near Reggae Shack. I'm trying to figure out where I can drop off old lightbulbs. I tried this on my iOS mobile, then my laptop. 
1- What genius thought that, instead of listing the businesses where you can do a drop-off, you should instead direct people to call a number to find out? Do you think this is user friendly? Would you rather use up billable hours of your employees so they can read us a list of businesses that would be far better communicated passively, on a functional website that provides locals with the information they're accessing the site for? 

It's shocking to me that you don't clearly list WHERE hazardous materials like lightbulbs and batteries can be dropped off. How many residents SHOULD be dropping them off responsibly? How many are even interested in finding out where? Of those who do go look, how many do you think call the hotline to find out where they can drop it off? Of those people, how many do you think make it? 

This failing on your part, I would imagine, directly contributes to TONS of hazardous waste being put into landfills. For god's sake, please fix your website and make this material that EVERY household should be aware of easy to learn about. 

Speaking of --- why are there no public education campaigns so that people automatically know where to return lightbulbs and batteries? 

This is a major failing that you can remedy quickly and cheaply, to immediate effect. Please fix this...... this failing makes government look as incompetent as we're always told it is.

I'd like to draw your attention to the pedestrian bridge over the Hogtown Creek just passed the traffic signal at NW 16th Street on NW 23rd Ave. It has been in disrepair and closed for well over a month.

Anyone traveling towards 13th Street or GHS by foot their path is obstructed and are forced to cross a the crosswalk just to the west without the benefit of the traffic signal.

I would like to request some signage or traffic calming device adjacent to the crosswalk until repairs to the bridge are completed.

Many people find themselves at risk due to limited visibility and excessive speed of vehicles, especially during the morning commute.

   Can you please have them removed so we feel safe in the yard so al we will think about is the ground collapse not the power lines.


Thank You

Subject: Trash pick up /Help

Good Morning,

My name is Audrey Brown I live in the Lincoln Estates Subdivision.
I’m writing you today as I have called 3 times and reported my garbage was not picked up on Wednesday, 3/24/2021. I was assured it would be done, but it’s Friday and still there. I have a large family.

I was told that the driver stated it was not out.  I have attached a photo from Tuesday night (3/23/21) after 10 PM showing the bin at roadside. I can also go back to 5:30PM March 23rd.  I just want the service that I pay for monthly. I also mentioned to the gentleman at 352-334-2330 that there is a piece of furniture that he stated would be picked up by 12:00 Thursday (3/25/21). It’s still there as of 7:30 AM (3/26/21) when I left my residence.

I would really appreciate if someone could look into this matter.
Thank you.

When attempting to cross NW 8th Avenue from south to north along the crosswalk at the east side of NW 22nd Street, I am unable to cause the walk light to turn on even after pressing the button several times.
Also, several years ago when the configuration of walk lights at that intersection was changed, the button for that walk light was relocated from the mast supporting the signal light at the corner, to the mast supporting the walk light about 10 feet down the sidewalk to the east. This makes it difficult for bicyclists crossing 8th Avenue as we have to go around the corner to press the button, then turn around and return to the corner to enter the crosswalk. Changing the configuration back so that the button is located at the corner instead of 10 feet down the sidewalk would be greatly appreciated.
